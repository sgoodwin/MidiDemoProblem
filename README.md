# MidiDemoProblem

This project demonstrates a problem I'm having with playing audio using a midi sampler based on user activity.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Compile and run the project 
2. Tap the button in the center of the screen
3. As long as you hold down the button, a should play a C.
4. Rapidly tap on the button
5. Eventually no piano sound will be produced, this is the problem.

## Notes

This issue does not seem to happen if you use the generic tone generator instead of attempting to load the piano's sound.
